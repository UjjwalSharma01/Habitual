## Key Components Implemented

1. **OnboardingContext** - A React context provider that manages the onboarding state, progression, and data storage in Firebase.

2. **Onboarding Flow Pages** - A sequence of premium UI screens that guide the user through the onboarding process:
   - Welcome & App Philosophy
   - Understanding User's Primary Goal
   - Understanding User's Current Lifestyle
   - Introduction to Habit Definition
   - First Habit Definition
   - Onboarding Success

3. **Reusable Habit Form** - A sophisticated form component used both during onboarding and for regular habit creation.

4. **Premium UI Elements** - Throughout the onboarding process, we've implemented:
   - Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion

5. **Smooth Transitions** - Framer Motion animations provide a premium, polished feel.

### PWA Implementation
1. **Service Worker Architecture** - Robust service worker implementation using Workbox for reliable offline functionality.
2. **Strategic Caching** - Multiple cache strategies tailored to different resource types (pages, assets, API data).
3. **IndexedDB Integration** - Complex offline data storage with synchronization capabilities.
4. **Background Sync** - Implementation of background sync for deferred operations when offline.
5. ~~**Push Notification System**~~ - (Temporarily removed to focus on core features)

## User Experience Benefits
